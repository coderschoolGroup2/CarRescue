## Personas

**Thao**
* 21 years old
* single
she owns a vespa bike given by her parents who live in other city, she doesn’t have any knowledge in mechanics, she thinks that the vespa bike is heavy for her
* Income: 100.000 per day including food, and university things 

Thao was going to meet her friends in District 1 and suddenly her vespa start to behave weird, when she stops to check discover that her bike has a flat tire, she is alone and is 7 pm, she need somebody that can fix the tire, she call her friends but they didn’t pick up the phone.
How we solve it: she needs a street mechanic, and she need one close because the bike is to heavy to carry it for to long and is to investable to drive it, we provide to her a way to found a street mechanic close to her location.
How she did it before: call her friends and as for help, or try to remember where is the latest street mechanic 

**Nguyen**
* 26 years old
* Hipster style 
* Engage 
He owns a old Honda 67, it doesn’t have functional instruments
* Income 13’000.000 dong per month

Nguyen is in the route to visit her girlfriend and suddenly the bike stop, there is anything wrong with the tire but when Nguyen decide to take a look to the tank discover that there is no gasoline, he looks around and he doesn’t see any gas station close, he try to look for one in google maps but is around 25 minute walking, he needs a gas boost

How we solve it:  Nguyen can use the app to see where is the closest street mechanic with a boost of gasoline that allow him to get to the closer station and later go to her girlfriend’s house.

How she did it before: he carries the bike all the way to the gas station, taking time to find it and to arrived there

It is the first time he owns and drive a motorbike, he has no knowledge of mechanics, one day his bike just didn’t start and he has no idea what is wrong, he need to go to work in couple hours, and use uber/grab will be expensive since he needs to go to several schools

How we solve it:  Jhon Doe, can go to the app and look for the closes mechanic that is in a walkable distance and can get his bike fix

How she did it before: he needs to find a garage an later pull the bike to the garage to get it fixed.

## User case (Value proposition)

*	With this app Thao can see where is the closest mechanics then she doesn’t need to carry her heavy bike meanwhile she looks around for somebody that can help her.

*	Nguyen can find a place to get a Gasoline Boost that help him to arrived to the station and later to her final destination

*	Jhon Doe can get her bike fix without need to go out to look in the alley and streets for a garage to get her bike fix

There is not a habit-forming app in all since of the word, but the target audience is big enough and the interest domain is a common giving the possibility of get a Wight enough target

Wireframe using Balsamiq and prototype using Principle

## Notes

* The lack of time didn't allow use to complete a more robust definition of the user personas and define clearly theri needs and behaviours 
* The user Stories present here are just EPICs and need to be break down in smaller and testable user Stories
